Superposition Theorem is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering used to analyze linear circuits with multiple independent sources. The theorem states that the response (voltage or current) in any element of a linear circuit is the algebraic sum of the responses caused by each independent source acting alone, while all other independent sources are replaced by their internal resistances. This experiment validates the theorem through practical circuit analysis.
